  "COMMON_ABOUT_US":"<div class=text-justify> <p> <h1> About us</h1> Welcome to the steemSTEM discord server. Please take some time to read the rules and FAQ. <h1> Rules:</h1> 1. Please be respectful to other members.</br> 2. Do not drop any steemit link.</br> 3. Do not beg for upvotes.</br> 4. Do not DM the management for upvotes.</br> 5. Use the server rooms according to their purpose (for e.g. do not chat in the ideas and complaints room).</br> 6. Why wasn't my post upvoted? <strong>isn't</strong> a complaint.</br> </p> <p> <h1> FAQs:</h1> <h2> What is SteemStem?</h2> SteemStem is a community on the Steem blockchain focused on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) topics. There is no membership required, you simply tag your post #steemstem to make it visible to the SteemStem curation team. As this is a community it is encouraged that you interact with other SteemStem members, including good quality comments and if you like, joining the discord channel. <h3> What does it mean to be a Steemstem Member?</h3> There is no official 'membership' status of Steemstem, but by being part of our growing initiative, you get to both enjoy a community of like-minded individuals as well as contribute your own value in return via posts, discussions, comments and other forms of engagement. <h2> My English is not so good, but I wish to write stem, what can I do?</h2> English is not necessarily a must. A recent development in the steemSTEM community has been our inclusion of multiple language curators. To date, we curate content in English, Spanish, French, Italian and German. There are currently no plans to expand this due to limited fundings. <h2> How is a post evaluated? </h2> <p>When curators find a potential post, they are looking for two things; ojective quality and subjective quality. First, they may check your references and your image credits to make sure they are available to be used for commercial purposes. They may follow this with a plagiarism check. </p><p>If the curator is uncertain, they may view your profile and comment history and other aspects of your authorship. Once the post is deemed legitimate and original, they will decide subjectively what the post's value is. This might involve length, style, effort, creativity and more.</p> <p>If the post is above our minimum vote, it must be double-checked by a member of the management team who may further check the above details before confirming the upvote.</p><p> But it doesn't end there. The honor members are also on the case, making sure the curation team is not being lax in their job, finding problems the management otherwise missed and more.</p> <h2> How do I get curated?</h2> The curators of Steemstem will primarily scour the 'Steemstem' tag for goodd posts. This is the most likely place to be discovered. However, curators are expected to go out into the wilderness of other STEM-related tags such as science, biology, chemistry, engineering and more, in hopes to find new users. When the staff deem your post valid, they will add it into the *Discord-curation-bot* channel, which triggers the substantial voting trail to automatically upvote according to the decided vote strength. This is public for anybody to see and dispute if need be. <h2> When should I use the SteemSTEM tag?</h2> Whenever you write a post of an academic nature which meets the standards set by our guidelines. You may also use the tag if you simply want the community to consider or discuss a certain topic, or debate on related philosophy, for example. <h2> My post is not upvoted, what now?</h2> There is no post promotion channel. The SteemSTEM tag functions as precisely that, so there is no need for another equivalent. If you haven't been upvoted, your post either fails to meet our standards or it has simply been missed. Curators are unfortunately all human so this happens from time to time, and we suggest you just keep writing - for passion, not for money. If your posts are good, you will eventually be noticed. </p> <h1> STEM Team </h1> <h2> Management </h2> @lemouth (Co-founder), @justtryme90 (Co-founder), @suesa (Community Relations Manager) @mobbs (General Manager), @anarchyhasnogods (Bot guy & Maintenance) <h2> Curators </h2> <h2> Reference Scientists </h2> @mathowl @scienceangel <h2> Collaborating Developers</h2> @reggaemuffin, @codingdefined, @fredrikaa, @howo, @upheaver <h2> Merchandise </h2> @zest, @elvisxx71, @branbello, @nonationnoborder <h2> Honor Members </h2> @alexdory @anevolvedmonkey @bachuslib @dexterdev @chloroform @christinaa @dexterdev @Egotheist @gra @JPederson96 @katerinaramm @kingabesh @lesshorrible @mathowl @Mountainwashere @noble-noah @physics.benjamin @pangoli[i-am-Groot] @Pearlumie @Rharphelle @sakura1012 @samminator @scienceangel @simplifylife @terrylovejoy @Tristan (robotics101) <h1> Discord Channels</h1> Though there are numerous private rooms dedicated to the curation process, management discussion and more, there are also plenty of public rooms to allow the community thrive, but also to allow as much openness as possible regarding who we curate and by how much and more.
