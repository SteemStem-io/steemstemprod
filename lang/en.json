  "COMMON_ABOUT_US":"<div class='ui label teal fluid'><h1>Our Mission </h1></div><p> <h4>Improving how STEM disciplines are communicated across the web, one blog post at a time.</h4></p><div class='ui label fluid'><h1>About steemSTEM</h1></div> <p>SteemSTEM began as a small project dedicated to improving the quality of STEM (science, technology, engineering & mathematics) content on the <a href='https://www.steem.io'><strong>Steem blockchain</strong></a>. However, as things unfolded, we realized that the importance of steemSTEM is greater than simply serving as curators for some niche topics on Steem. </p><p>The problem as we see it, has always been that those with the greatest knowledge of STEM subjects (*i.e.* researchers actively involved in groundbreaking research) lack incentive to communicate their work to mainstream audiences, leaving the majority of scientific reporting to journalists. As a result, only the most positive, groundbreaking and bizarre stories get heard, often becoming misinterpreted ‘fake news’ by mainstream media. </p> <p>We at steemSTEM offer a different approach. We provide a space among a thriving global community of like-minded individuals where both experts and passionate STEM bloggers can freely distribute their knowledge in a social media environment that actively promotes and rewards honest, reliable and high-quality content.Inspired by the scientific method itself, SteemSTEM offers a three-layered system of review for each publication we promote: <li><strong>Curators</strong> first read, review and have their decisions verified by a second curator.</li> <li>A team of <strong>honor members</strong> scrutinizes the actions of curators, having rewards removed among other necessary actions.</li></p><p><li>Every promotion is open to the public who can further scrutinize and push for any necessary actions against misleading or fraudulent content that managed to pass through.This process means that SteemSTEM is one of the greatest spaces on the blockchain to find trustworthy, uncensored information that is both readable and enjoyable to be a part of.</li><p>SteemSTEM now offers content in 5 languages: English, French, German, Italian and Spanish.</p> </p><div class='ui label fluid'><h1>The steemSTEM Team</h1></div><div class='ui cards'><div class='ui card'><div class='image'><img src='./images/team/rbauer.jpg'></div><div class='content'><a class='header'>Robert Bauer</a><div class='descrition'><a href ='https://steemit.com/@justtryme90'>Blog on Steem</a></div></div><div class='ui label'>Robert is a PhD biochemist and pharmaceutical research scientist with over 10 years research experience focused on the kinetic characterization of DNA replication enzyme complexes and rare genetic diseases.

  "COMMON_FAQ":"<div class='ui label teal fluid'><h1> Welcome Guidelines</h1></div><p> <h4>Welcome to the steemSTEM discord server. Please take some time to read the rules and FAQ.</h4> </p><div class='ui label fluid'><h1> Rules:</h1></div> <p>1. Please be respectful to other members.</br> 2. Do not drop any steemit link.</br> 3. Do not beg for upvotes.</br> 4. Do not DM the management for upvotes.</br> 5. Use the server rooms according to their purpose (for e.g. do not chat in the ideas and complaints room).</br> 6. Why wasn't my post upvoted? <strong>isn't</strong> a complaint. <p> <div class='ui label teal fluid'> <h1> FAQs:</h1> </div><div class='ui label fluid'> <h2> What is SteemStem?</h2></div> <p>SteemStem is a community on the Steem blockchain focused on STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) topics. There is no membership required, you simply tag your post #steemstem to make it visible to the SteemStem curation team. As this is a community it is encouraged that you interact with other SteemStem members, including good quality comments and if you like, joining the discord channel.</p> <div class='ui label fluid'><h3> What does it mean to be a Steemstem Member?</h3></div><p> There is no official 'membership' status of Steemstem, but by being part of our growing initiative, you get to both enjoy a community of like-minded individuals as well as contribute your own value in return via posts, discussions, comments and other forms of engagement.</p><div class='ui label fluid'> <h2> My English is not so good, but I wish to write stem, what can I do?</h2></div><p> English is not necessarily a must. A recent development in the steemSTEM community has been our inclusion of multiple language curators. To date, we curate content in English, Spanish, French, Italian and German. There are currently no plans to expand this due to limited fundings. </p><div class='ui label fluid'><h2> How is a post evaluated? </h2></div> <p>When curators find a potential post, they are looking for two things; ojective quality and subjective quality. First, they may check your references and your image credits to make sure they are available to be used for commercial purposes. They may follow this with a plagiarism check. </p><p>If the curator is uncertain, they may view your profile and comment history and other aspects of your authorship. Once the post is deemed legitimate and original, they will decide subjectively what the post's value is. This might involve length, style, effort, creativity and more.</p> <p>If the post is above our minimum vote, it must be double-checked by a member of the management team who may further check the above details before confirming the upvote.</p><p> But it doesn't end there. The honor members are also on the case, making sure the curation team is not being lax in their job, finding problems the management otherwise missed and more.</p><div class='ui label fluid'> <h2> How do I get curated?</h2></div><p> The curators of Steemstem will primarily scour the 'Steemstem' tag for goodd posts. This is the most likely place to be discovered. However, curators are expected to go out into the wilderness of other STEM-related tags such as science, biology, chemistry, engineering and more, in hopes to find new users. When the staff deem your post valid, they will add it into the *Discord-curation-bot* channel, which triggers the substantial voting trail to automatically upvote according to the decided vote strength. This is public for anybody to see and dispute if need be. </p><div class='ui label fluid'><h2><p> When should I use the SteemSTEM tag?</h2></div><p> Whenever you write a post of an academic nature which meets the standards set by our guidelines. You may also use the tag if you simply want the community to consider or discuss a certain topic, or debate on related philosophy, for example. </p><div class='ui label fluid'><h2> My post is not upvoted, what now?</h2></div><p> There is no post promotion channel. The SteemSTEM tag functions as precisely that, so there is no need for another equivalent. If you haven't been upvoted, your post either fails to meet our standards or it has simply been missed. Curators are unfortunately all human so this happens from time to time, and we suggest you just keep writing - for passion, not for money. If your posts are good, you will eventually be noticed. </p> <div class='ui teal label fluid'><h1> STEM Team </h1></div> <div class='ui label fluid'><h2> Management </h2> </div><p>@lemouth (Co-founder), @justtryme90 (Co-founder), @suesa (Community Relations Manager) @mobbs (General Manager), @anarchyhasnogods (Bot guy & Maintenance) </p><div class='ui label fluid'><h2> Curators </h2> <h2> Reference Scientists </h2></div> <p>@mathowl @scienceangel <div class='ui label fluid'><h2> Collaborating Developers</h2></div> <p>@reggaemuffin, @codingdefined, @fredrikaa, @howo, @upheaver </p><div class='ui label fluid'><h2> Merchandise </h2></div><p> @zest, @elvisxx71, @branbello, @nonationnoborder </p><div class='ui label fluid'><h2> Honor Members </h2></div> <p>@alexdory @anevolvedmonkey @bachuslib @dexterdev @chloroform @christinaa @dexterdev @Egotheist @gra @JPederson96 @katerinaramm @kingabesh @lesshorrible @mathowl @Mountainwashere @noble-noah @physics.benjamin @pangoli[i-am-Groot] @Pearlumie @Rharphelle @sakura1012 @samminator @scienceangel @simplifylife @terrylovejoy @Tristan (robotics101) </p><div class='ui teal label fluid'><h1> Discord Channels</h1></div><p> Though there are numerous private rooms dedicated to the curation process, management discussion and more, there are also plenty of public rooms to allow the community thrive, but also to allow as much openness as possible regarding who we curate and by how much and more.
